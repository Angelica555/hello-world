# hello-world
Testing the GitHub application.
Hi, I have been sitting at starbucks doing my homework, running some test cases for the enr site. However, the system is down :(. I have to wait until it is up and running.
Vijay is on his way to meet me and finish the homework. I hope he is not tired to do some homework.
